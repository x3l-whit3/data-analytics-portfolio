## End-to-end case studies using SQL and R

Hi, I’m Alexandre Leblanc.  
I am a data analyst focused on behavioral analysis, data cleaning, and insight generation using SQL and R.

This repository contains a series of end-to-end case studies demonstrating my approach to real-world data problems. The projects emphasize stakeholder-driven questions, careful data preparation, exploratory analysis, and clear visualization leading to actionable recommendations.

The analyses are primarily conducted in R, with SQL used for data extraction and transformation where appropriate.

## Repository Overview

This repository is organized as a series of independent case studies.

Each case explores a real-world dataset and follows an end-to-end analytical process:
- business question definition
- data preparation and cleaning
- exploratory analysis
- visualization
- insights and recommendations
